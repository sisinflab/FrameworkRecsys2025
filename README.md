This repository provides the framework for participating in the RecSys Challenge 2025, organized by Synerise and ACM RecSys.

It enables:

-generation of Universal Behavioral Profiles for users,

-training of graph-based recommendation models (GNN, LightGCN, GIN, GAT, NGCF, etc.),

-evaluation of the quality of the generated embeddings,

-combination of multiple user/item representations via horizontal concatenation.
